# This script sets up a development environment that allows you
# to selectively run unit and integration tests interactively against local,
# containerized instances of the Conjur Service Broker and Conjur.
#
# In this development environment, the Service Broker source code is
# volume mounted in the Service Broker instances, so that any changes that
# you make to Service Broker code is immediately reflected in the
# Service Broker instances. In other words, there is no need to rebuild
# and restart containers when code changes are made.
#
# After starting up Service Broker and Conjur instances, the scripts 
# leave you in an interactive shell that prompts you to select one of the
# following:
#
#    1) Run rspec unit tests
#    2) Run integration (non-E2E) Cucumber tests
#    3) Select from a list of Cucumber features to test
#    4) Select from a list of Cucumber scenarios to test
#    5) Run a bash shell in test container
#    6) Exit and clean up development environment
#
# When you choose options 3) or 4), you will be prompted to select from
# a list of Cucumber features or scenarios, respectively. This allows you
# to run focused tests as you are iterating through code changes.
#
# Option 6) will let you exit the test container, and all Service Broker
# and Conjur container instances will be cleaned up.
