# At the moment, we do not pull any private gems. Updating to 
# a fixed version of bundler requires updating the whole project to Ruby
# 3.0, which breaks the tests. CONJSE-1571 is entered for this upgrade 
# process. For now, ignore the bundler CVEs since we don't trigger them
# but we need to check it if we change the Gemfile.
